MODSBridge
==========

A curriculum for learning to batch edit [MODS][mods] records, inspired by [RailsBridge][rb]. There are many people with metadata backgrounds working in libraries who want to learn programming skills, but do not want to become web developers. Instead, they want to learn how to maintain metadata for digital libraries. At the same time, digital libraries need help maintaining metadata, adhering to standards, augmenting records, and migrating formats. Unfortunately, there is currently a gap between the people who have the metadata expertise and the tools used by digital libraries to manage data. This curriculum is an attempt to bridge that gap.
